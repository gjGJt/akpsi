    <p>
      Thank you for considering the possibility that the QR code was not just for show. 
      I did not think this was worth doing as the person reading my application must be overtaxed reading a ton of applications already.
      But in the off chance that it does get viewed, I think the rabbit hole metaphor will really describe me well as a person. 
      I don't take things, features, or certain experiences for granted. I'll go the extra mile even if it results in 
      a small increase in overall utility or a unique experience. In this case, I went for an image inside an image concept as I 
      think it represents the difference between how I portray myself in front of other people and how I think of myself internally.
